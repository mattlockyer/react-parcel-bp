# React, Redux, Redux Thunk
Bundled with Parcel 2.0 (nightly)

## Changelog
16-06-2020
* stripped all styles
* this boilerplate will remain free of css / ui components

## Principles
* goal: write less code (see use of redux)
* start project with basic routes (@reach/router)
* fork, add ui framework, go

## Minimal Redux?
* helpers for default state and reducer
* dispatch + hooks vs. actions
* generic redux utils found in `/util/redux-util.js`
* a slight "re-think" of redux streamlining dev and file overhead
