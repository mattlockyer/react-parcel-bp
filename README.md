# React, Redux, Redux Thunk, Chakra, Emotion
Bundled with Parcel 2.0

## Minimal Boilerplate
* goal: write less code, build more routes & components
* opinionated file structure
* simple CSS resets

## Redux?
* helpers for default state and reducer
* dispatch + hooks vs. actions
* generic redux utils found in `/util/redux-util.js`
* a slight "re-think" of redux and streamlining of files
